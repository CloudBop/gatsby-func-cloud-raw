# The smallest possible Gatsby theme

## Quick Start

```shell
mkdir my-site
cd my-site
yarn init
# install gatsby-theme-minimal and it's dependencies
yarn add gatsby react react-dom gatsby-theme-minimal
```

Then add the theme to your `gatsby-config.js`. We'll use the long-form
here for educational purposes.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-theme-minimal",
      options: {},
    },
  ],
};
```

That's it, you can now run your gatsby site using

```shell
yarn gatsby develop
```

Note that this site doesn't _do_ anything, so you're seeing a missing
resources error. Create a simple page in `src/pages/index.js` to see a
page on the root url.

```jsx
import React from "react";

export default function Home() {
  return <div>My Site!</div>;
}
```

## Doing more with themes

You can use this as a place to start when developing themes. I
generally suggest using [yarn
workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) like the
[gatsby-theme-examples repo
does](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-theme-examples),
but using `yarn link` or `npm link` is a viable alternative if you're
not familiar with workspaces.

3 directories, 10 files
```

### `gatsby-theme-minimal`

This directory is the theme package itself. You should rename this at
some point to be `gatsby-theme-{my-theme-name}`. Also change the
`package.json` name field and the corresponding dependency in the
example directory's `package.json`/`gatsby-config.js` to match the chosen name.

- `gatsby-theme-minimal/`
  - `gatsby-config.js`: An empty gatsby-config that you can use as a starting point for building functionality into your theme.
  - `index.js`: Since themes also function as plugins, this is an empty file that
    gatsby needs to use this theme as a plugin.
  - `package.json`: The dependencies that your theme will pull in when people install it. `gatsby` should be a `peerDependency`.

### `example`

This is an example usage of your theme. It should look the same as the
site of someone who installed and used your theme from npm.

- `example/`
  - `gatsby-config.js`: Specifies which theme to use and any other one-off config a site might need.
  - `src/`: Source code such as one-off pages or components that might live in
    a user's site.

You can run the example with:

```shell
yarn workspace example develop
```
